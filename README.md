# Tools-for-symmetric-products-of-finite-and-infinite-matrices
These are tools for the tensor constructions underlying all representations of finite-dimensional dynamical systems as infinite-dimensional linear systems.
These include the echeloned expressions of the fundamental (and system) matrices for the linearized higher variational equations of arbitrary systems along an arbitrary particular solution.

The references these tools draw from are:

[1] Sergi Simon, Linearised higher variational equations. Discrete Contin. Dyn. Syst. 34 (2014), no. 11, 4827--4854.

[2] Sergi Simon, Conditions and evidence for non-integrability in the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker Hamiltonian. J. Nonlinear Math. Phys. 21 (2014), no. 1, 1--16.

[3] Sergi Simon, Formal first integrals and higher variational equations, 2023 preprint, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.04449

and a similar (albeit non-monic) construction is also described in

New files and tools, as well as corrected updates of existing ones, will be routinely added to this repository.
